Do we recall the words said by the Demochipi unto his maker?

Does any man know the dying-cries of the truly blessed, that we might repeat them and fashion ourselves after their glory? Certainly not.&#x20;

Recall, then, the story of the saint, starving on the plain in the Goentish lands. His hand closed around a clutch of dry clay, and with hoarse lips he said unto The Blessed One:

"I ask not that you fortify me, that I might fashion this clay of the earth into my drinking-vessel, and so preserve the scarce waters of this place.

I ask that you fortify me, Master, that I might fashion myself into a drinking-vessel for your grace, and daub this clay upon my flesh to seal my cracks.&#x20;

For I am not so arrogant as to say, 'I am not at all broken'. You, Mother, pour your grace into us by day and by night, and it spills through cracks and seeps into the ground.&#x20;

So, I ask you to guide my hand, as I fashion and seal my drinking-vessel, so that when you pour into me grace, it shall be captured and sealed, as spirits in an earthen ware.&#x20;

It is the hand of the most skillful potter on earth who is second to you, and even then the margin is as vast as the distance between land and sky. I know I am no skilled potter. I know, though I have in my life endeavored, I am no more perfect a vessel for your grace than any.&#x20;

So, when I daub, daub with me. As I fashion my vessel, let it surely be yours as well. When the jackals come upon me, let them remark:&#x20;

His is the shape that was fashioned by the most high.&#x20;

Or rather,

He is the one who has acquiesced to the fashioning.

And most certainly:

He is the one who has fashioned himself, by the decree of the most high, in the image of the coming of Heaven."

He said,

"I am most blessed."

And he was still.
