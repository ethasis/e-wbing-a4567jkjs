# Tagmallo

In Gesena, in the time of the Nadiechi, whose reigning-stone will stand upon Onafhara as surely as Heaven's coming, a pious man was named Tagmallo. He was a farmer, and he tilled the fields yearly, and was glad to work the earth by his hands and sweat alone.&#x20;

He had a daughter by his late wife, whose name had been Zostra. His daughter was Zofina, and for his love she was called Tagmallon. For his village, Tagmallo studied the Precepts dutifully. The assembly oft wept at his voice. He had gone to Tanthis in the months prior; and he there sought blessing for his Godson's birth, who was born Tamio, by Prianzo.&#x20;

On Tagmallo's return, which followed a grueling sojourn through the steeps, which were thence untamed, and the wilds, where even today in the auspices of our Sasinthene rule beasts roam and prey upon godly men, his kinfolk were joyous at his safe return. So caught up were they in song and elation that not one man dared pass on the ill tidings.

From the time of his leaving, two weeks passed, and his daughter grew ill with a wasting, her skin was pale, and she passed blood. Tagmallo found her taken ill, and the jubilations ceased in the town thenceforth, until with a grim countenance he reported to them her passing. In The Blessed One's mercy, she did not cry out once before the end, at which point she smiled, and she passed from this world.

As a ready scholar, Tagmallo was well-read on the funeral customs of his people before the time of Nadiechi, and certainly our Sasinthene rule. Though in his day the days of mound-building and the raising of great stele had waned and stood in the sole purview of the wealthy, when the vigil ended he secreted his beloved daughter up the mountain. I dare not reveal which peak, lest I risk her disturbance.&#x20;
