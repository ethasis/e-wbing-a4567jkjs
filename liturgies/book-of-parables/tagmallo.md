# Tagmallo

In Gesena, in the time of the Nadiechi, whose reigning-stone will stand upon Onafhara as surely as Heaven's coming, a pious man was named Tagmallo. He was a farmer, and he tilled the fields yearly, and was glad to work the earth by his hands and sweat alone.&#x20;

He had a daughter by his late wife, whose name had been Zostra. His daughter was Zofina, and for his love she was called Tagmallon. For his village, Tagmallo studied the Precepts dutifully. The assembly oft wept at his voice. He had gone to Tanthis in the months prior; and he there sought blessing for his Godson's birth, who was born Tamio, by Prianzo.&#x20;

On Tagmallo's return, which followed a grueling sojourn through the steeps, which were thence untamed, and the wilds, where even today in the auspices of our Sasinthene rule beasts roam and prey upon godly men, his kinfolk were joyous at his safe return. So caught up were they in song and elation that not one man dared pass on the ill tidings.

From the time of his leaving, two weeks passed, and his daughter grew ill with a wasting, her skin was pale, and she passed blood. Tagmallo found her taken ill, and the jubilations ceased in the town thenceforth, until with a grim countenance he reported to them her passing. In The Blessed One's mercy, she did not cry out once before the end, at which point she smiled, and she passed from this world.

As a ready scholar, Tagmallo was well-read on the funeral customs of his people before the time of Nadiechi, and certainly our Sasinthene rule. Though in his day the days of mound-building and the raising of great stele had waned and stood in the sole purview of the wealthy, when the vigil ended he secreted his beloved daughter up the mountain. The peak in question shall be known alone to those who seek it with benevolence.

Tagmallo was beset by wolves and lions and scavenging birds. The child's flesh had not yet begun to putrefy; but by their wicked senses these beasts knew that they needed only prise the body from her father's arms for their meal.

When in the dead of night they approached his fire to snap at her flesh, Tagmallo cried out:

"Do you not see that I am aggrieved? Do you not see that I carry my only daughter, my beloved, who died so recently that her flesh has not become putrid? Surely there are those among you who have felt my pain. Why do you not snap at my flesh, why can you not eat of me instead? Rather, you seek to devour the remains of my most beloved child before my eyes."

In that instant, a stalking lioness leapt from the brush, and in a rasping and bestial tongue she made answer, and The Blessed One likened Tagmallo's ears to hear her words, and so was her roar:

"Is it not so, that all creatures, especially those so low and loathsome as we, should yearn for the touch of something beloved? I am a hated beast who snatches babes from their cribs, and I pass on the dusty ground beneath your feet. Is it not so that I should yearn for the substance and touch of that which is most high?"

Tagmallo was struck dumb by these words, and not only because his ears were likened to the tongue of beasts. He found the response troubling, because Zofina had not lived to join the congregation, yet this lioness spoke as though she was a saint. In his confusion, he dropped his crook, and the lioness leapt, yet when her teeth touched Zofina the fire swelled with a sudden burst, and caught her fur alight. With his crook, Tagmallo struck her down the mountainside.&#x20;

As the beast fell, she proclaimed:

"I am most blessed."

A vicious monkey stepped forward, for he too wished to be blessed, and Tagmallo struck him dead with his crook. So, the congregation of beasts permitted him to pass up the mountain with his daughter.&#x20;

When he reached the peak, he buried Zofina, and stacked atop her grave four stones, and then he prayed.

"Master, I have entirely failed my daughter. I could not keep her life, and now she lies dead, and moreover she lies beneath this insult. I have fashioned her a marker, but my hands are only deft enough to stack stones atop her site. I am filled with fear that this meager shrine will grow fragile, and some malignant beast shall steal her bones."

And his inventor answered:

"Why for do you weep? You have raised the peak of this mountain for your child, and this mountain stands higher than before. It is so that toppling a mere capstone from the stele shall not defile the grave."

It is so that a prophet once said, "They will scrape uselessly at my works and be blinded by the rising sun."

His inventor said:

"No man exists who shall move this mountain without the assistance of my hand. You have dedicated this monument to my glory by your love and humility. And so, your daughter is the touch and the substance of the most high. You shall praise her in all the manners of a saint, and you shall instruct your followers to do so as well."

Tagmallo said:

"I am most blessed."
