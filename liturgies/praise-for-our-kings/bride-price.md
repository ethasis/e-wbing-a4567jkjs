# Bride-Price

And the Halls of the House of Namori were thrown open, and from within, there came the sound of much deliberation. The hall was raised at the brow of a hill, which had been flattened by digging. On each of its corners rose earthworks. There was a switchback that came up; in this season the river was high, and it made as a moat.&#x20;

Under each of the four corners of this high hill, the river coursed around. It coursed so that its waters scrubbed clean and made firm corners out of the Hall of Namori. The house-servants of Namori were distraught, because their fields had been consumed ahead of harvest-time, and the ground would be too drunk to sow.

Lo, he stood at his threshold, and spoke unto his house, which was consumed by worryful chattering at the destruction of the year's grain.&#x20;

As peace was the star at his brow, and stern was his hand, his servants were calmed by his words. He called out for me, who is Yosar, his scribe, and first among his sons, and I answered. I was instructed to mark his words, and verily I did, for he said unto the house:

"Have no fear, for I am lord here in these lands,"

And we did not, for peace was the sign and the star at his brow. Stern was his hand, we were calmed by his words.

"The river at the foot of this house is my vassal. I shall command him to recede, and he shall give up our fields unmolested."

And so in his house there was stillness. In two rows we stood, about the King, who had not called forth his entourage. Then, I stood apart from them, as he instructed, for I was his scribe, and it was mine to mark well his words.&#x20;

Verily, I was told to accompany Namori to the riverbank. I saw it course at the corners of his homestead. With a churning rage, it roared and battered each corner, it carved out the faces of every mountain. The waters still held fear for me, since though my mother had sprung from amongst the reeds, it was not my native land.

Thence, I stood amongst the reeds, and Namori before me. He said (and thus, I marked):

"You, O river who courses at the foot of my homestead, I bid you recede. I turn upon you the sign at my brow; its star is peace. But I shall warn you, though wisdom tempers my hand, it is stern. You shall not defy me."

Then, I, Yosar, who these words have dutifully recorded, heard the river speak, filled with a terror and loathing.&#x20;

"Your glory has not set my course, O Lord. I shall not deviate for the word of you, for you have left my house empty for want of my daughters, you have taken them like a cattle-thief, and you have left me devoid of bridal price."

At once, I took both feet from the riverside mud, and scourged their skin, for I was sickened by the river's disobedience. I averted my gaze, though I had been told to mark, for I feared the raising of Namori's hand, but the star of peace prevailed for this moment. His hand remained low, his voice that of earnest supplication, though the river scorned him so.

"Then come into my court, O river, so that we may hear your petition. I shall forgive this rebellion, for you are the father of my wives; it is right that a son-in-law should defer to his father-in-law."

Thus, Khürüdi, who was the surging waters, came into my father's court. I, Yosar, begin transcript of this proceeding, I mark it for the records of my king, in whose mercy was invented the act of jurisdiction.

Khürüdi accused:

"You who styles himself Lord of this land, you take my daughters for your own without bride-price rendered duly."

This I record as the primary accusation of Khürüdi, for it stirred Namori to deep deliberation. From his wives he called out Varrat, whose fingers were ringed and upon whose neck was hung chains. She had no knowledge of jurisprudence, but had twice before asked bride-price for her daughters, Kattar and Sondi, who had married skilled farmers. While Varrat made procession through the adjoining hall, Namori said:

"The customs of neighboring clans are too barbaric to render bride-prices. It is true, should you have heard, that in my reign I have made edict mandating its practice, for I am chiefmost among lovers of wisdom, but to raise a fist to strike at my house for want of a bride-price is absurd in these lands."

He said:

"Thus, I ask you, as my wife approaches to give apt counsel in this situation, what bride-price can you ask, save for my mercy in these dealings?"
