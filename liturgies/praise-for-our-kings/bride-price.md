# Bride-Price

And the Halls of the House of our King were thrown open, and from within, there came the sound of much deliberation. The hall was raised at the brow of a hill, which had been flattened by digging. On each of its corners rose earthworks. There was a switchback that came up; in this season the river was high, and it made as a moat.&#x20;

Under each of the four corners of this high hill, the river coursed around. It coursed so that its waters scrubbed clean and made firm corners out of the Hall of Namori. The house-servants of Namori were distraught, for their fields had been consumed ahead of harvest-time, and the ground would be too drunk to sow.
