# Songs of Demarcation

Son of the first waters, you are he who arose among the silt and salt and smoke. Son of the first waters, whose inky dark choked the stars, you are he who first set the waters apart from the sky, and apart from the earth, who is our Mother, from whom you came. In this time, as you set the waters from the sky, O son, it was dark, for the body of your Mother still choked the great lights of the sky. For this, O son, you are our King.

You, O first son, saw that the heavenly lights were still blotted; they slumbered in our Mother's womb, they had not yet been born. There was no light to see by, so you bade our Mother churn up the silt and salt and smoke at her depths, and churn up the stars her shadow swallowed, and become the soil by the river-bank whose handfuls bake in the sun. And thence, the sun's light filled out brush upon the ground, by your speaking, O son; and for this, you will reign together until the sky stops.

O son, who heralded the birth of light upon the face of our Mother and Queen, your world was barren, and you had no counsel; Your courts lied empty, your halls were silent, and your words, while heeded, went without argument. Not a voice could be raised that might meet yours, and so temper your logic, and so deepen your wisdom, O King. The floors of your hall were bare, and echoed at your thunderous passage, and the vaults on high carried naught but whispers, and the shuddering of doors in the wind. Thus, you saw the place where your council would convene, O son; and for this, you are our King.

Now, at your bidding to your Mother and Queen, your fiefs were alight; Your acres, which were the countenance of our Mother, were dry and fertile. Beneath the complexes of your ruling-court, which stood at a bend above the widest river, you went amidst the reeds and marches, O son. Into the house of the river you passed, our King, and you stood amidst the waters as they diverted about you into tall walls. You drew up silt from its floor, and you endowed it with your life, and so conceived sons; Apart from them you took an advisor to sit your counsel.&#x20;

Our King said:&#x20;

"I shall be first among lovers of wisdom. My reign shall not be that of a fool, one who forbids questioning, and keeps no wise counsel. First among you I select my counsel. And so you will sit my court, and keep my counsel, until the sky stops."

And for this, O son, you are our King.&#x20;

You and your Queen so churned up the river-silt and the salt where it met the seas on all sides, and smoke once more, and you set it spinning within the water. You separated from the throng your advisor, and the rest sought to keep your court apart from him. You summoned this counsel to your throne, and ruled with a wise hand. Then, O son, your hall was one filled with voices, apart from your own. From the crowing and crying of this assembly that kept your hall, you instructed the voices find logic, and their words find meaning. For this, O son, you are our King.

But the waters you set churning, amidst the reeds into which you sojourned rose up, and they swept into your hall, and your doors were thrown wide. The voice of the water said thus:

"You, O King upon the Throne, have taken from my depths my silt, my daughters, who once danced and swam within my house, and you have taken them without a bride-price rendered duly. By them, you have fathered innumerable sons, and in your fashion they have bereft me my daughters for wives, and they now curse me when I rise in the wet-season to flood."

And then the hall once again filled with voices, and there was much deliberation. You, wise King, were not so proud that you could not offer bride-prices for this bereft father. But he, with scales like a fish, spat at your rendered wealth, and chafed at your words. He was incensed by your works, and by the beauty of your children. He said,

"It is not your glory that has created the world, O son."

He said,

"It is any hand that can throw a pot. The infirm can build vessels of river-silt; and the witless can shape its form."

And incensed by your works, he spat forth a throng of his own sons, but their skin was that of fish, their mouths great and toothy, and their hearts were black. O King, we your sons were unwise in that time, and we mocked their misshapen bodies, and we cursed these misbegotten cousins. But by your hand and stern brow you made us wary against foes in our midst, and so we were. We trembled in your court, but thence we were made wise. For this, you are our King, O Father of Wisdom.
